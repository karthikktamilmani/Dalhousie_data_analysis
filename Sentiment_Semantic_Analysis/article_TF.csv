31,at the under 17 world cup in brazil this november the us mexico and canada took to the international stage with thoughts already turning to the 2026 world cup that will be hosted by the three nations here bbc sport profiles three players one from each country who are already being described as future stars who could make their mark at the tournament alvarez has a dog called salah named after the liverpool forwardefrain alvarez la galaxy mexico date of birth 19 june 2002 function if window bbcdotcom bbcdotcom adverts bbcdotcom adverts slotasync bbcdotcom adverts slotasync mpu 1 2 3 position midfielderefrain alvarez might just be the most coveted north american footballer since freddy adu the 17 year old la galaxy forward has been called by far the biggest talent in the mls by none other than zlatan ibrahimovic it s little surprise then that he s the subject of an international tug of war born in california to immigrant parents from mexico efra grew up in east los angeles and joined the galaxy under 9s when he was seven years old even at that age he was attracting some very influential admirers one of his matches that season was watched by eric cantona legend has it the former manchester united player then director of football at new york cosmos was in town for a few under 17s and under 19s games but it was alvarez who caught his eye with cantona saying i ve seen enough i just want to watch this kid all day the frenchman moved on but alvarez progressed for the under 14s he scored a cantona esque lob for his 24th goal in 19 games and when he turned professional by joining the galaxy s second team aged 15 years and one month he became the youngest signing in united soccer league history usurping alphonso davies the canadian now playing for bayern munich alvarez is deployed mainly as a creative number 10 and has a left foot that can split defences in a second he pairs it with an innate knack for finding the back of the net the youngest player to hit a hat trick in the usl championship he scored 12 goals for galaxy ii on the way to being named their 2018 young player of the year after making his first team debut in march this year he contributed three assists in 14 mls appearances ibrahimovic who left galaxy in november has had nothing but praise for his protege you see when he plays he s all natural the way he thinks the way he moves the ball the way he touches the ball the swedish striker told reporters in july he s by far the biggest talent in the mls he thinks football he has that football in him and it s natural alvarez has always been regarded as the standout in a family that he says has football in our blood two of his older siblings have played professionally with brother carlos now at las vegas lights alongside as fate would have it a 28 year old adu one player who did not quite live up to the billing he was given as a teenager yet while everything is sweet at the galaxy at national team level there have been hiccups alvarez represented the usa for three years and even captained the country s under 15s at a youth tournament in argentina scoring a hat trick en route to the title yet two months later after a run of just one start in four games he decided to ditch red white and blue in favour of mexican green the 23 potential world cup 2026 venues in canada the united states and mexico 16 will be selected there were and still are no decisive factors really alvarez tells bbc sport when asked about his decision to switch it s just wherever i am happy right now i m happy with mexico so as long as i m happy it s going to be mexico but in the future you never know this november alvarez helped mexico reach the final of the under 17 world cup where they lost 2 1 to hosts brazil marco ruiz mexico under 17 coach describes him as very promising committed and important to me yet despite being involved in more goals than any of his team mates alvarez was also often the first player to be substituted boasting a thickset build reminiscent of a young carlos tevez he does not share the argentine s tireless running and completed 90 minutes just once in brazil i have talked to him about dynamics ruiz adds he needs to be a little bit more dynamic if he moves a little faster he will find better spaces to take advantage of all his talent alvarez s world cup campaign in a microcosm came in the semi final against the netherlands starting on the bench he was introduced in the 73rd minute equalised in the 79th then in the shoot out struck a horrible panenka penalty that was easily saved mexico still went through and afterwards he suggested in a very zlatan like way that he would do it again most do not dare i dared somewhat enigmatically alvarez says he does not remember where he was when he learned north america will host the 2026 world cup nor is he willing to gaze too far into the future i obviously want to go to every world cup i can every tournament every game he says i don t want to miss one game but i take everything day by day i don t like to look too far forward giovanni reyna borussia dortmund usa date of birth 13 november 2002 position forward reyna has been playing in the u19 bundesliga this seasonthe united states disappointed in brazil exiting the group stage following heavy defeats by senegal and the netherlands and a 0 0 draw with japan if their much hyped

through named after giovanni van bronckhorst his dad s former team mate at rangers perhaps the hardest thing to accept will be that arguably for the first time in his fledgling career he was not the standout performer among players his own age reyna was born in england and has been regarded as the jewel of his generation for more than a decade comparisons with america s soccer sweetheart pulisic were perhaps inevitable but they sharpened this summer when aged 16 reyna signed for dortmund after gaining a portuguese passport through his paternal grandmother maria the german club s assistant manager jorg heinrich says reyna is similar or maybe a little bit better than 21 year old pulisic such talk does not faze a teenager who has been encircled by expectation since his days dominating at under 9 level aged five years old now 6ft 1in he has an assertive presence on the field can read a game well and is at his best when driving at pace towards defenders he carries the ball quickly but in a style closer to one of his favourite players kaka than his compatriot pulisic of course it s nice to be compared to christian because he s the best american player right now but really i would like to create my own path reyna who exchanges messages with pulisic tells bbc sport it s good to have someone only a few years older than me that i can look up to we have similarities but we are very different players so i think some years down the line we can make a good duo media playback is not supported on this device three countries react to getting the world cup 2026 bid during under 17

g_center h_180 pg_1 q_80 w_320 dzssymqsgdsv4gvndsrj jpg articlebody activists with the satanic temple say a now former therapist in canada has been pushing conspiracies about globe spanning mind controlling cults for years and after they exposed some of her professional talks to her licensing board she voluntarily gave up her psychology license n nin june a representative of the satanic temple sent a complaint about retired therapist alison miller to the college of psychologists of british columbia the organization responsible for licensing psychologists in the province though miller retired from practicing therapy in 2018 the complaint accused her of causing harm by spreading the dangerous notion that satanic cults engage in ritual abuse of children in her public speeches and published books n n nthe presentations highlighted in the complaint including one titled working through your traumatic memories and destroying the mind control were given by miller at a 2017 conference hosted by survivorship an organization billed as a support group for victims of ritual abuse the president of survivorship a massachusetts based licensed mental health counselor named neil brick claims he is a ritual abuse survivor who was programmed by the illuminati into becoming a killer and spy n nin miller s presentations she passes along tales of her patients being abused by cult members who dressed up as satan red tail and all at another point she describes trying to steer a patient away from her belief that she had been abducted by aliens instead she said it was more likely that a cult had implanted the memory of aliens in the patient in order to make her seem crazy miller also claims that repressed memories can be stored in the body and can periodically emerge as physical convulsions akin to electroshock memory flashbacks and that victims of ritual abuse often cope with their trauma by dissociating and forming multiple personalities though she refers to these personalities as parts n n it can be hard to undo the damage of false memories n nmiller detailed many of these ideas in her 2011 book healing the unimaginable treating ritual abuse and mind control and though it s unclear how many patients miller may have worked with during her career her linkedin page indicates she had been practicing as a registered psychologist in british columbia since 1990 more than 25 years n nwhile still a matter of great controversy some mental health professionals do believe that people can develop multiple personalities as a result of severe trauma a condition called dissociative identity disorder or did in the dsm but according to steven lynn director of the laboratory of consciousness cognition and psychopathology at binghamton university in new york most of miller s claims about how our memory functions let alone the existence of these cults are dubious n n there is no scientific support that can be claimed for the validity of these statements in fact they are at the fringes of pseudoscience much less grounded in evidence that would be accepted in any corner of the scientific community he told gizmodo via email referring to the stories miller told of patients with repressed memories of cults and aliens that could cause seizure like flashbacks n nfounded in 2013 by lucien greaves a pseudonym the satanic temple is most known for its political activism the group s name being somewhat tongue in cheek as its members don t literally worship the devil they ve protested against lawmakers who are openly influenced by their conservative religious beliefs in defiance of the separation between church and state in several states they ve even sued the government for restricting residents access to abortion arguing that such laws threaten the religious freedom and beliefs of their members who worship an unabashedly pro choice satan meant as a symbol for the need to rebel against arbitrary authority though envisioned as a high minded satire of right wing christianity the satanic temple has evolved into a genuine movement warts and all with chapters throughout the u s and non profit status n nbut greaves has said that the inspiration for the satanic temple came from a very specific period during the 1980s and 1990s when law enforcement agencies prosecutors and the media stoked a moral frenzy over satanic cults supposedly kidnapping murdering and wiping out the memories of people across the world the satanic panic as it came to be known was aided by a small but influential group of mental health and self help professionals who claimed they could dredge up the repressed memories of their patients often said to be caused by ritualistic cult abuse ultimately however no objective evidence ever emerged of these cults existing and at least some patients retracted their claims of repressed memories saying it was the therapists who had victimized them with manipulative techniques meant to elicit false recollections n nthough the satanic panic is no longer dominating headlines the satanic temple says remnants of the panic are still around today in the form of therapists and others who espouse discredited theories about repressed memories and fearmonger about clandestine cults to that end they ve established a dedicated off shoot to investigate and bring attention to these therapists called grey faction n n the heyday of this was the 1980s and 1990s sure but it never really totally went away and there hasn t been much of a reckoning in the mental health field n n there are a couple of different groups and organizations with individuals who continue to promote the idea that there are roving gangs of satanists abducting and abusing people so severely that they block it from their memory and that these memories can only be recovered with the aid of a therapist at some point in the future grey faction director evan anderson told gizmodo by phone grey faction claims that miller was one of these individuals n non october 22 the college of psychologists of british columbia cpbc responded to anderson s complaint having conducted its own review in response to the cpbc s investigation miller defended her statements citing some research and arguing that she was voicing the stories of her patients and had no reason to doubt their authenticity attempts to reach miller by gizmodo have so far been unsuccessful n n the respondent stated that her views regarding diagnostic and treatment issues related to survivors of ritual abuse have been taken out of context or misinterpreted the cpbc wrote in its reply to anderson n nthough the cpbc declined to investigate the allegations of patient mistreatment in part due to miller s retirement status the organization nonetheless concluded that on their face many of the respondent s statements are unusual and do not reflect mainstream beliefs about abuse trauma and mental health they were also concerned that miller expressed a degree of certainty about the activities of cults that may not be warranted yet she did not limit her statement with a caution about the sources of her information n nordinarily the cpbc s findings might have prompted further action up to and including professional censure but according to the response miller told the cpbc during the investigation that she thought she needed to retain a non practicing license in order to have access to her practice s records after being told that wasn t the case miller sent a letter in late august stating that she was giving up her license as a result the investigation would be officially closed the cpbc told anderson n nwhile the cpbc s findings aren t as emphatic as grey faction would have liked anderson nonetheless considers it a victory as the decision will prevent miller from offering continuing education units which are collected by therapists and social workers to maintain their license through her presentations nor will she the cpbc noted be able to call herself a psychologist n nit s fair to say that we re no longer at the peak of the satanic panic and as lynn notes the more outlandish beliefs expressed during the panic by therapists and others are not widely accepted in the mental health field but there are still many people who believe that repressed memories exist and that anyone can successfully dig them out with the right methods despite decades of research suggesting that these techniques are more likely to create false memories n nas many as 8 percent of therapy patients in the u s according to a 2018 study have seen a therapist who floated the possibility of them having repressed abuse while 5 percent have actually undergone therapy to recover these memories just last year gizmodo reported on teal swan an internet spiritual guru who encourages her followers on youtube to do processes that uncover so called repressed memories and swan herself was likely influenced by a therapist who played a key role in the satanic panic n n unfortunately research shows that a minority of therapists and counsellors around the world still believe damaging memory myths julia shaw a uk based psychological scientist who has studied and written about the phenomenon of false memory told gizmodo in an email i have worked on legal cases myself in which impossible memories of abuse are described impossible for logistic reasons like the defendant not being in the country at the time or because their brains could not have remembered the event they were too young to be able to form memories

pre school booster that maximizes immunity when 95 of a population is immune to measles the disease cannot spread this is known as herd immunity and it is the cornerstone of the who s long held plan to eradicate measles globally achieving this would rid the world of a very serious disease for which 1 in 1 000 cases is fatal in 2010 eradication was considered achievable by 2020 but that time is almost here and the disease is not close to being eradicated in fact it is on the rise part of nature outlook vaccines during the first half of this year europe had 90 000 cases of measles more than 17 times the number reported in the whole of 2016 in august the united kingdom lost its measles free status as did albania greece and the czech republic the united states which is currently experiencing the highest number of measles cases since 1992 is also at risk of losing the measles free standing that it has held since 2000 the resurgence of measles is a symptom of falling rates of immunization against infectious disease when immunization rates drop and herd immunity frays it s always measles that comes back first says paul offit a paediatrician specializing in infectious disease at the children s hospital of philadelphia pennsylvania measles is the canary in the coal mine earlier this year the who named hesitancy to vaccinate as one the ten gravest threats to global health as a result governments around the world are considering policies that would make vaccinations mandatory over the past 5 years legislators in australia france and italy have restricted school access for children who haven t received the country s recommended panel of vaccinations including mmr some us states are doubling down on existing vaccination requirements for schoolchildren by removing the ability for parents to legally refuse vaccines for non medical reasons and in september the uk health secretary matt hancock responded to pressure including a letter from four prominent london doctors calling for action to address the united kingdom s falling immunization rates with the announcement that the government had taken legal advice on how it might make vaccinations compulsory this is a common reaction among politicians says noni macdonald a paediatrician at dalhousie university in halifax canada and a founding member of the who s global advisory committee on vaccine safety but mandates are not as clean a solution as policymakers might hope a variety of incentives and penalties have been employed with differing levels of enforcement and the effectiveness of each approach is not clear cut because the factors driving low immunization rates are not the same everywhere in the world macdonald says that governments should frame their policy making decisions around two questions what problem are you trying to fix and is a mandate the way to fix it a pressing need in a better world we wouldn t need mandates says offit people would educate themselves about vaccines and make the best decision for their children and for themselves assuming there s not a medical contraindication they d get vaccinated every time evidence of vaccination s effectiveness is resounding government agency public health england estimates that the measles vaccine first introduced in the united kingdom in 1968 and combined with mumps and rubella vaccines in 1988 has prevented 20 million cases of measles and saved 4 500 lives widely used vaccines have excellent safety records in terms of improving public health vaccination is second only to providing clean drinking water despite this countries around the world are failing to varying extents to reach levels of coverage required to achieve herd immunity especially for mmr misinformation is a major problem according to offit there s a lot of bad information out there he says it scares people begs them to make bad decisions other researchers say that vaccines are victims of their own success a worldwide survey published by the london based charitable foundation wellcome see go nature com 2qg0mnp this year showed that vaccine hesitancy is a problem mainly in high income countries where widespread immunization has made outbreaks of infectious disease much less common as cases become rarer the number of people with first hand experience of the seriousness of the diseases diminishes belief in the need for vaccinations weakens as more people calculate that the safer course is to go without them says helen bedford a children s health specialist at great ormond street institute of child health london when the disease isn t around she says half the equation has been removed all the risk is focused on the vaccine it is against this backdrop that the idea of enforcing vaccination is raised proponents of mandatory vaccination argue that despite what is arguably a removal of individual freedom the ethical justification for intervention is twofold the first argument is that the state is acting to prevent parents from making decisions on behalf of their children that unnecessarily expose them to the risk of infectious disease through this lens mandating vaccination is akin to legally requiring that young children are secured in an appropriate car seat the second argument is that failure to vaccinate not only puts the unvaccinated individual at risk but also anyone they come into contact with including those too young to be immunized and people who for medical reasons cannot be vaccinated the libertarian argument falls apart offit says if you ve made the choice to put your child in harm s way and to put those who they come into contact with in harm s way then you ve done harm his opinion echoes that of the us supreme court of 1905 which upheld the legality of an 1809 mandate for smallpox vaccination in massachusetts stating there are manifold restraints to which every person is necessarily subject for the common good making a mandategovernments can never force someone to get themselves or their child vaccinated it is a foundational principle of medical ethics that consent must be given for any procedure the decision to make vaccination mandatory is therefore a decision to impose some form of penalty on those who do not follow the law a common penalty is to exclude unvaccinated children from school because these are hotspots for disease outbreaks this has long been the case in the united states since 1980 all 50 states have formally linked vaccination to school entry australia france and italy have taken similar action australia also has legislation that withholds financial child support from the parents of unvaccinated children without medical exemptions in italy fines are also levied on parents but penalties can be considerably softer josephine sauvage one of the london doctors who wrote to the uk health secretary suggests that a mandate could record children s vaccination status at school entry and require anyone who declines immunizations to register a conscientious objection it would be the first such uk mandate since one was implemented for smallpox more than 100 years ago a measles outbreak in april led to the new york mayor declaring a public health emergency credit erik pendzich alamy although mandatory vaccination has existed in various forms for more than 200 years there is a paucity of good epidemiological studies of the effects of different mandates macdonald says the introduction of new laws is often accompanied by increased publicity about vaccination which makes it harder to identify the specific effects of legislation the social contexts in which mandates are applied also vary from place to place and are continually shifting in the united states which recommends a panel of vaccinations the number of states with specific mandates proliferated from 20 in 1963 to all 50 plus the district of columbia in 1980 that expansion was backed by nationwide surveys in the 1970s showing that the incidence of measles was higher in states without mandates and lowest in states where mandates were strictly enforced early evidence from italy and france shows that immunization coverage has risen with the introduction of mandates and the no jab no pay legislation withholding state benefits that was introduced in australia in 2015 coincided with full immunization rates rising by around 3 nationwide coverage is now nearly 95 several us states have taken steps to restrict people s ability to opt out for non medical reasons in 2016 after a well publicized outbreak of measles at disneyland in california the state made it impossible for people to legally opt out of immunization on anything other than medical grounds legislators in new york took the same action this year after a measles outbreak in brooklyn as did the state of maine there is evidence that the california legislation has worked between 2013 and 2017 the proportion of children attending kindergarten who were not up to date on their vaccinations halved to 4 9 but this might not tell the whole story daniel salmon director of the johns hopkins institute for vaccine safety in baltimore maryland points out that the number of unvaccinated children being educated at home in california almost quadrupled between the 2016 17 and 2018 19 school years salmon also contends that increases in immunization rates have been largely offset by a spike in the number of medical exemptions awarded since the 2016 legislation came in there is evidence of physicians listing conditions not typically viewed as contraindications for vaccination a further round of legislation introduced in california in september will see the reasons physicians give for medical exemptions monitored and controlled more closely the wrong problemsfor salmon the game of legislative cat and mouse in california highlights the problems that can emerge when lawmakers try to combat a complex social phenomenon with tighter regulations mandates he says are a quick legislative fix that will have an effect to some extent but to achieve stable high vaccination rates in the long term public health policies need to address the underlying causes of faltering uptake the problem highlighted by the who earlier this year was not vaccine refusal but vaccine hesitancy in most countries the proportion of the population that staunchly opposes vaccines is less than 2 the bigger problem salmon says is the much larger group of people with some concerns about vaccination that might make them hesitant he estimates that up to one third of americans have concerns about vaccines making the laws stricter doesn t address that he says the small albeit vocal minority of people who refuse vaccines outright rarely change their minds the much larger hesitant population however does respond to information campaigns therefore rather than directing a limited pot of money health system resources and political capital towards levying penalties for non compliance salmon would prefer to see greater investment in education and more efforts to facilitate meaningful conversations between concerned people and health care professionals currently the opportunity is limited in the united states salmon says there is no insurance code through which paediatricians can be reimbursed for consulting with parents on vaccination and bedford says that in the united kingdom the number of health visitors the public health practitioners who typically have such conversations has been cut by one third in recent years macdonald agrees with the need for greater engagement different parents have different concerns about vaccines for instance some fear alleged impurities in the vaccine whereas others are concerned about minor side effects studies show that public messages that broadly extol the safety of vaccines are less effective than addressing parents specific questions bedford however argues that blaming falling immunization coverage on vaccine hesitancy neglects another bigger problem ensuring access to vaccines this issue is commonly associated with low income countries and certainly measles outbreaks last year in yemen and venezuela can be directly attributed to social and political events that disrupted medical services but says bedford even in high income countries efforts to make sure that people know how and when to get their children vaccinated are falling short work needs to be done and she fears that focusing resources on implementing mandates would detract from it in the united kingdom bedford says vaccination rates are lowest in socially disadvantaged areas and communities in which people frequently move around in parts of london which has the lowest immunization rates in the country one in three infants change address before they re one meaning that the health system often loses contact with them more from nature outlooks for these reasons bedford and others argue that punitive mandates can lead to disadvantaged groups bearing the brunt of financial and social penalties peter mcintyre who studies paediatric infectious disease at the university of sydney in australia says that he had similar reservations when australia hardened its stance on vaccination although the campaign focused on a middle class demographic who had lodged non medical exemptions under the old system this wasn t the largest group not getting vaccinated that comprised people who were not accessing health services because of socioeconomic factors he was concerned that denying financial support and educational opportunities to people on low incomes who were already experiencing difficulty accessing health care would only increase health disparities now however he says his fears have been at least partially allayed the australian government took steps to improve access by improving the vaccination register making vaccines available to older children to catch up and investing in

75,in 2015 the world health organization who declared that the united kingdom had eradicated the infectious viral disease rubella the following year it similarly designated the country as measles free

food retailer shutterstock the average canadian family will pay up to an extra 487 on feeding themselves next year according to an annual food price report that highlights climate change as a major culprit for rising food prices especially in the produce department unexpected snowstorms droughts and other weather events have impacted crops and food prices in the past said simon somogyi lead researcher from the university of guelph but for 2020 he and others behind the report highlight climate change as the cause we re deliberately pointing out that you know climate change is causing the droughts is causing the bad snowstorms that s impacting prices he said the report calls the impact of changing weather patterns on our food systems through droughts forest fires heavy precipitation reduced freshwater access and rising sea levels the elephant in the room for 2020 canadian farmers will face challenges in the future dealing with unpredictable crop yields heat wave livestock threats pasture availability and pest and disease outbreaks reads the report from researchers at dalhousie university and the university of guelph that link between climate change and food prices comes along with a forecast that the average canadian family will spend 12 667 on food at grocery stores and restaurants in 2020 that s two to four per cent more than in 2019 thought the researchers expect it to be closer to the top end of that range it s the second highest prediction since 2013 it s outdone only by an anticipated three to five per cent or 420 rise for the year 2017 the algorithm provides a two per cent range for the national forecast the expected rise in food prices comes as canadians face relatively steady inflation the consumer price index rose 1 9 per cent year over year in october according to statistics canada the same increase as the previous two months increases have remained below 2 5 per cent since sept 2018 next year researchers expect price increases in all eight food categories they track with the biggest jump four to six per cent in meat pork prices will likely lead that ascent due to the african swine fever outbreak in china roiling pork markets food sold at restaurants as well as seafood and vegetables will likely see the next biggest price increases in 2020 the report estimates a jump of two to four per cent in those three categories the estimated rise in vegetable prices comes after a staggering 12 per cent increase for the 12 months ended sept 2019 much of that double digit jump somogyi attributes to climate change storms and other weather events wreak havoc on logistics he said they can slow down transportation for example and create a shortage that results in higher prices a hotter climate is one factor behind an increase in bacterial outbreaks such as e coli somogyi said as hotter temperatures and unpredictable heat waves increase bacterial growth in recent years multiple e coli outbreaks prompted grocers to pull romaine lettuce off their shelves and restaurants to stop serving the leafy green that tends to drive up prices for alternatives like spinach produce prices also trend up because canada imports vast amounts of its food as the colder weather in the country limits what can be grown imported goods can fluctuate in price due to trade issues creating slowdowns at borders or weather events impacting delivery

family will pay up to an extra 487 on feeding themselves next year according to an annual food price report that highlights climate change as a major culprit for rising food prices especially in the produce department unexpected snowstorms droughts and other weather events have impacted crops and food prices in the past said simon somogyi lead researcher from the university of guelph but for 2020 he and others behind the report highlight climate change as the cause we re deliberately pointing out that you know climate change is causing the droughts is causing the bad snowstorms that s impacting prices he said the report calls the impact of changing weather patterns on our food systems through droughts forest fires heavy precipitation reduced freshwater access and rising sea levels the elephant in the room for 2020 canadian farmers will face challenges in the future dealing with unpredictable crop yields heat wave livestock threats pasture availability and pest and disease outbreaks reads the report from researchers at dalhousie university and the university of guelph that link between climate change and food prices comes along with a forecast that the average canadian family will spend 12 667 on food at grocery stores and restaurants in 2020 that s two to four per cent more than in 2019 thought the researchers expect it to be closer to the top end of that range it s the second highest prediction since 2013 it s outdone only by an anticipated three to five per cent or 420 rise for the year 2017 the algorithm provides a two per cent range for the national forecast you might be interested in the expected rise in food prices comes as canadians face relatively steady inflation the consumer price index rose 1 9 per cent year over year in october according to statistics canada the same increase as the previous two months increases have remained below 2 5 per cent since sept 2018 next year researchers expect price increases in all eight food categories they track with the biggest jump four to six per cent in meat pork prices will likely lead that ascent due to the african swine fever outbreak in china roiling pork markets food sold at restaurants as well as seafood and vegetables will likely see the next biggest price increases in 2020 the report estimates a jump of two to four per cent in those three categories the estimated rise in vegetable prices comes after a staggering 12 per cent increase for the 12 months ended sept 2019 much of that double digit jump somogyi attributes to climate change storms and other weather events wreak havoc on logistics he said they can slow down transportation for example and create a shortage that results in higher prices a hotter climate is one factor behind an increase in bacterial outbreaks such as e coli somogyi said as hotter temperatures and unpredictable heat waves increase bacterial growth in recent years multiple e coli outbreaks prompted grocers to pull romaine lettuce off their shelves and restaurants to stop serving the leafy green that tends to drive up prices for alternatives like spinach you might be interested in,5684,1,0.00017593244194229416

controlling cults for years and after they exposed some of her professional talks to her licensing board she voluntarily gave up her psychology license n nin june a representative of the satanic temple sent a complaint about retired therapist alison miller to the college of psychologists of british columbia the organization responsible for licensing psychologists in the province though miller retired from practicing therapy in 2018 the complaint accused her of causing harm by spreading the dangerous notion that satanic cults engage in ritual abuse of children in her public speeches and published books n n nthe presentations highlighted in the complaint including one titled working through your traumatic memories and destroying the mind control were given by miller at a 2017 conference hosted by survivorship an organization billed as a support group for victims of ritual abuse the president of survivorship a massachusetts based licensed mental health counselor named neil brick claims he is a ritual abuse survivor who was programmed by the illuminati into becoming a killer and spy n nin miller s presentations she passes along tales of her patients being abused by cult members who dressed up as satan red tail and all at another point she describes trying to steer a patient away from her belief that she had been abducted by aliens instead she said it was more likely that a cult had implanted the memory of aliens in the patient in order to make her seem crazy miller also claims that repressed memories can be stored in the body and can periodically emerge as physical convulsions akin to electroshock memory flashbacks and that victims of ritual abuse often cope with their trauma by dissociating and forming multiple personalities though she refers to these personalities as parts n n it can be hard to undo the damage of false memories n nmiller detailed many of these ideas in her 2011 book healing the unimaginable treating ritual abuse and mind control and though it s unclear how many patients miller may have worked with during her career her linkedin page indicates she had been practicing as a registered psychologist in british columbia since 1990 more than 25 years n nwhile still a matter of great controversy some mental health professionals do believe that people can develop multiple personalities as a result of severe trauma a condition called dissociative identity disorder or did in the dsm but according to steven lynn director of the laboratory of consciousness cognition and psychopathology at binghamton university in new york most of miller s claims about how our memory functions let alone the existence of these cults are dubious n n there is no scientific support that can be claimed for the validity of these statements in fact they are at the fringes of pseudoscience much less grounded in evidence that would be accepted in any corner of the scientific community he told gizmodo via email referring to the stories miller told of patients with repressed memories of cults and aliens that could cause seizure like flashbacks n nfounded in 2013 by lucien greaves a pseudonym the satanic temple is most known for its political activism the group s name being somewhat tongue in cheek as its members don t literally worship the devil they ve protested against lawmakers who are openly influenced by their conservative religious beliefs in defiance of the separation between church and state in several states they ve even sued the government for restricting residents access to abortion arguing that such laws threaten the religious freedom and beliefs of their members who worship an unabashedly pro choice satan meant as a symbol for the need to rebel against arbitrary authority though envisioned as a high minded satire of right wing christianity the satanic temple has evolved into a genuine movement warts and all with chapters throughout the u s and non profit status n nbut greaves has said that the inspiration for the satanic temple came from a very specific period during the 1980s and 1990s when law enforcement agencies prosecutors and the media stoked a moral frenzy over satanic cults supposedly kidnapping murdering and wiping out the memories of people across the world the satanic panic as it came to be known was aided by a small but influential group of mental health and self help professionals who claimed they could dredge up the repressed memories of their patients often said to be caused by ritualistic cult abuse ultimately however no objective evidence ever emerged of these cults existing and at least some patients retracted their claims of repressed memories saying it was the therapists who had victimized them with manipulative techniques meant to elicit false recollections n nthough the satanic panic is no longer dominating headlines the satanic temple says remnants of the panic are still around today in the form of therapists and others who espouse discredited theories about repressed memories and fearmonger about clandestine cults to that end they ve established a dedicated off shoot to investigate and bring attention to these therapists called grey faction n n the heyday of this was the 1980s and 1990s sure but it never really totally went away and there hasn t been much of a reckoning in the mental health field n n there are a couple of different groups and organizations with individuals who continue to promote the idea that there are roving gangs of satanists abducting and abusing people so severely that they block it from their memory and that these memories can only be recovered with the aid of a therapist at some point in the future grey faction director evan anderson told gizmodo by phone grey faction claims that miller was one of these individuals n non october 22 the college of psychologists of british columbia cpbc responded to anderson s complaint having conducted its own review in response to the cpbc s investigation miller defended her statements citing some research and arguing that she was voicing the stories of her patients and had no reason to doubt their authenticity attempts to reach miller by gizmodo have so far been unsuccessful n n the respondent stated that her views regarding diagnostic and treatment issues related to survivors of ritual abuse have been taken out of context or misinterpreted the cpbc wrote in its reply to anderson n nthough the cpbc declined to investigate the allegations of patient mistreatment in part due to miller s retirement status the organization nonetheless concluded that on their face many of the respondent s statements are unusual and do not reflect mainstream beliefs about abuse trauma and mental health they were also concerned that miller expressed a degree of certainty about the activities of cults that may not be warranted yet she did not limit her statement with a caution about the sources of her information n nordinarily the cpbc s findings might have prompted further action up to and including professional censure but according to the response miller told the cpbc during the investigation that she thought she needed to retain a non practicing license in order to have access to her practice s records after being told that wasn t the case miller sent a letter in late august stating that she was giving up her license as a result the investigation would be officially closed the cpbc told anderson n nwhile the cpbc s findings aren t as emphatic as grey faction would have liked anderson nonetheless considers it a victory as the decision will prevent miller from offering continuing education units which are collected by therapists and social workers to maintain their license through her presentations nor will she the cpbc noted be able to call herself a psychologist n nit s fair to say that we re no longer at the peak of the satanic panic and as lynn notes the more outlandish beliefs expressed during the panic by therapists and others are not widely accepted in the mental health field but there are still many people who believe that repressed memories exist and that anyone can successfully dig them out with the right methods despite decades of research suggesting that these techniques are more likely to create false memories n nas many as 8 percent of therapy patients in the u s according to a 2018 study have seen a therapist who floated the possibility of them having repressed abuse while 5 percent have actually undergone therapy to recover these memories just last year gizmodo reported on teal swan an internet spiritual guru who encourages her followers on youtube to do processes that uncover so called repressed memories and swan herself was likely influenced by a therapist who played a key role in the satanic panic n n unfortunately research shows that a minority of therapists and counsellors around the world still believe damaging memory myths julia shaw a uk based psychological scientist who has studied and written about the phenomenon of false memory told gizmodo in an email i have worked on legal cases myself in which impossible memories of abuse are described impossible for logistic reasons like the defendant not being in the country at the time or because their brains could not have remembered the event they were too young to be able to form memories

one of 33 syrian kids brought to the u s by a group of syrian americans in 2011 the year the civil war broke out it was not part of his plan he laughs not in a million years did i think i would come here as a transfer student but it was a way out of a vicious war that is still roils on today with 6 million people displaced and an estimated 500 000 dead george and the original 33 have all stayed and excelled today they are bankers architects lawyers and academics they are thriving and many are on a path to u s citizenship since 2016 george and a number of his cohort have been paying it forward and mentoring bright syrian kids their express aim is getting them into colleges here in america with success before the ban they helped 65 students to move and study abroad on full scholarships i has this idea that instead of fundraising millions of dollars to bring students here we have a lot of very brilliant students there and a number of universities here who offer scholarships they founded a small non profit organization called the syrian youth empowerment initiative between their own busy millennial lives of work dating and staying in touch with family scattered around the world george now 27 and his friends search for the brightest syrian high school students they can find these include kids in refugee camps in countries that neighbor syria and in active warzones inside syria with the bombs and blackouts that come with that syrian refugees have been forced to find safety all over the world and the students reflect that among them are refugees in denmark malaysia armenia and bahrain the non profit works with these kids over skype facebook whatsapp and email to get their toefl qualification their sats and their college applications in tip top shape all the mentors were from the first 33 it s not political we want to help and this is education based we did not discriminate against high school students based on politics on their religion or their background says george this year and last 10 kids were accepted on full scholarships worth approximately 15 million to harvard dartmouth mit georgetown and others the universities are helpful and they have come to understand some of the realities facing these syrian kids for example if a school gets bombed transcripts will be destroyed and they work around that after this herculean effort on the part of the students and their mentors and often the universities too it was almost unbearable for eight of them to learn earlier this year that the u s government won t let them in looking out

here are alarmed at the growing number of obstacles being thrown in the path of almost all international students by this administration aside from rising anti immigrant rhetoric the past two years have seen new rules limiting and complicating many aspects of the lives of student visa holders these include entrance to the country their legal status here and ultimately their ability to stay and work in july of this year harvard president larry bacow wrote to the state department s secretary pompeo and homeland security s acting secretary mcaleenan stating that a global reach is essential for his university to thrive i understand that the responsibility for the uncertainties in today s immigration policy rest more broadly than just with your two agencies that said the visa and immigration process is increasingly unpredictable and uncertain this poses risks not just to the individuals caught up in it but also to the entirety of our academic enterprise two syrian students mentored by george and his peers got full ride places at harvard this year but their visas were denied on appeal without any explanation they were granted and the kids arrived on time to start school it s wonderful for them and for harvard but there was no stated difference between their applications and later their appeals than those of the other syrian students who d been accepted by other

loss driven by his former country s unnervingly rapid warming and its overpowering role as oil magnate a role that may one day influence the fragmentation of millions of migrants own disjointed memories n n n almost every immigrant s relationship with the past has an element of quicksand to it el akkad a novelist who was born in egypt grew up in qatar left for canada at 16 and now lives in portland oregon told earther you just don t get the privilege of a single unchanging story to lean back on a single root system you know is going to be there n nwith climate change there s an added intangible uncertainty mixed in with the tangible he added it s not just our changing landscapes or our potentially uninhabitable homelands at stake it s our histories too if we forget the past forget what led us here to this moment are we not as philosopher and poet george santayana once said condemned to repeat the worst of times couldn t an erasure of the past give way to more strategized denialism in the name of political or national gains would a melting away of history rip out the very foundation of a community s roots n nvictoria herrmann managing director of the arctic institute has witnessed this threat of erasure firsthand in the arctic s many indigenous rural communities n n n it s a constant fear of losing who you are of redefining who you can be if you re no longer the seaside traditional tribal village you ve always been she told earther n nin the absence of forced migration individuals typically migrate for education for jobs for better lives but sometimes we forget that who we are is directly connected to landscape the physical space and history embedded in that land water and air herrmann said this is especially true among indigenous communities many of whom have a spiritual and emotional connection to their physical environments n nwhen for example the shore fast ice pathway connecting families in neighboring alaskan villages melts away the cohesive fabric of everyday life and intergenerational life changes in real time she said n n it s often about the things you can t see herrmann said about the impact of climate change on the fragmentation of our histories when we return to the lands we used to know and no longer recognize the grounding memories of hunting out on the ice with your father or your first kiss as a teenager feel like parts of a past life memories you forgot to mourn n n it doesn t mean that there isn t resilience in these communities or visions for how to survive herrmann added but it also comes with trauma and grief with an echo of intergenerational injustice n noutside of the arctic region which has lost 95 percent of its oldest documented sea ice qatar is one of the fastest warming areas of the world it s also a country where 88 percent of the population is made up of migrant workers many of whom reportedly experience exploitative and abusive treatment in return for the lure of comparably high wages made possible by the country s oil economy it s not uncommon for individuals from neighboring nations to immigrate to qatar to support family back home n nand business there is booming if qatar were to turn off its natural gas and oil industry said el akkad the country would be immediately rendered economically and politically irrelevant and therein lies the primary clash in the environmental debate n n climate change poses a direct conflict between the short term interests of the most powerful people on earth versus the long term interests of everybody said el akkad in qatar where carbon emissions per capita are the highest in the world and three times as high as the u s that conflict is playing out right before our eyes n nthe country s fossil fuel exports are driving climate change ramping up heat that s making living there increasingly challenging extreme temperatures caused a disaster at the world athletics championships marathon held there earlier this year to combat the unbearable heat for residents which has consistently exceeded a blistering 115 degrees fahrenheit in recent summer months the fabulously rich country and leading exporter of liquefied natural gas has begun to air condition the outdoors the short term solution to this longstanding worsening affliction as the washington post s steven mufson points out is being temporarily dealt with thanks to some inventive engineering and gobs of money n nwhen el akkad left qatar in 1998 he left amid the hottest summer in the country s history at the time the severe heat waves maxed out at 117 degrees fahrenheit and were associated with the 1997 98 el niño year but outdoor air conditioners there were no outdoor air conditioners n n nmigrants like el ekkad who have willingly left the lands they once called home often experience the grief of climate disruption and dissonance upon their temporary returns but the millions still living in the most vulnerable regions of the world are forced to contend with more violent shocks to their sense of place and cultural memory as the climate crisis worsens n n a damaged relationship with the past is at the heart of so much of the violence we do to one another as a species n nin the poorest and most unprepared countries places lacking qatar s technical and financial resources where civilians are at highest risk of climate induced migration even a temporary albeit expensive band aid won t suffice n nin 2018 alone the internal displacement monitoring centre recorded 17 2 million new displacements associated with environmental disasters in 148 countries and territories drought alone displaced 764 000 people in somalia afghanistan and several other countries n nin an ideal world herrmann said resilient migration has a bottom up vision and is supported by top down funding indigenous communities most at risk would have a prominent voice in what their futures look like and governing councils would help grant financial backing n nthe small community of shaktoolik alaska home to about 260 people is one example of such resilience in action in the face of uncertainty in the past 100 years the village has had to relocate twice due to flooding and storm surge its abandoned old site just two miles from the new shaktoolik is a reminder that there is a limit to even the most resilient community s ability to adapt herrmann highlighted for the national trust for historic preservation n nbut despite inevitable chaos city mayor eugene asicksik and other local leaders have been working with a long list of state and federal agencies and organizations to ensure the community remains at the head of the decision making table n ntogether local and federal entities developed a defend in place adaptation plan to address shaktoolik s potential relocation and long term strategies in a way the community understands and sees fit according to the national oceanic and atmospheric administration by remaining unified and maintaining control shaktoolik has put itself in a better position to ensure higher quality of life and cultural preservation for the next generation it could provide a template for other villages across the arctic which are facing similarly dramatic climate shifts that upend people s livelihoods and histories n nbut communities aren t monoliths and they re certainly not always unified in opinion or place

143,canada has received more than its usual share of attention for its ai capabilities the country was either prescient or lucky in continuing to fund neural networks research when the us retreated from it in the 1970s and 80s as a result canadian researchers like geoffrey hinton yann lecun who is french american but worked with hinton s group in toronto and yoshua bengio pushed forward the methods we now call deep learning these three researchers won the 2018 turing award often called the nobel equivalent for computer science canada is also known in ai for its collegial public private ecosystems they incorporate government funding venture capital university research initiatives and private sector sponsorship the country has well developed ecosystems driven by academic research centers now in several cities in canada shelby austin who leads deloitte s ai practice called omnia ai in canada helped me understand how the ecosystems work the most prominent research centers are in toronto centered around the vector institute for artificial intelligence the montreal institute for learning algorithms mila in that city and the alberta machine intelligence institute amii in edmonton these three research centers received a 125m cad grant over five years from the canadian government for a pan canadian artificial intelligence strategy each of these research centers as well as those in other university rich canadian cities like vancouver and waterloo has corporate sponsors however the centers and the corporate relationships are relatively new and like most university research centers around the world are still learning how best to turn theory into commercial practice canada has already demonstrated that these ecosystems can create ideas for how to develop ai algorithms not only deep learning perhaps the fastest growing ai technology but also reinforcement learning and generative adversarial networks gans are algorithm types with strong canadian roots the remaining question is whether canada s ai structures can develop business applications of ai that lead to commercial success for companies and substantial numbers of jobs in canada granted big companies like google facebook microsoft and samsung have opened research labs in canada and have lured canadian ai experts to come to work for them but could there be canadian firms that make hay from ai austin says that the jury is still out on that issue but there are several canada based organizations that are trying to address it by employing an ecosystem based approach in montreal the most prominent example is elementai a 2016 startup that is attempting to create a series of ai software solutions it has close ties with montreal universities and yoshua bengio a professor at the university of montreal is one of its co founders it portrays itself as an alternative to firms like google and facebook employers of hinton and lecun respectively who are viewed as hiring away academic ai talent elementai has a set of fellows academics who want to see their ideas implemented in business who maintain their academic appointments and work a few hours a week for the startup there are also current students working as interns for elementai and elementai employees are involved in a variety of collaborative projects with academic researchers however since the company is relatively new and is attempting to build ai infrastructure that other firms can use it s perhaps too early to know if it will ultimately be successful in toronto the creative destruction lab cdl at the university of toronto s rotman school of business is an incubator and accelerator of ai startups rather than a startup itself its goal is to accelerate entrepreneurship by providing linkages to mentors and investors for early stage companies using ai and other emerging technologies the cdl was established in 2012 and from its beginnings in toronto has expanded to five other canadian cities new york and oxford while it counts 72 ai startups as alumni it s still early to say whether it can create successful ai firms large corporations in canada its largest banks in particular are participating in these university based centers but several have also created groups of researchers many of which are also university faculty within their own walls royal bank of canada s borealis and td bank s layer 6 are wholly owned business units largely comprised of ai researchers who have maintained their university appointments some of them are also affiliates of the university research labs we ve just discussed canadian ai ecosystem relationships are rich complex and often overlapping all of these organizations and their web of relationships are not only a test of canada s ability to create large ai firms but could also provide a model for other countries around the world the ecosystem approach in which academics work closely with private sector firms venture capitalists and government is pretty unusual in the united states at least for ai it is more common in pharmaceuticals and life sciences where there are mediating organizations similar to those in canada that we ve described the ecosystem model is important to success both within and across organizations to be effective developing and implementing ai strategy requires the active participation of multiple stakeholders business leaders ai technologists and policymakers must all play a role more specifically organizations looking to implement this model should consider organizing break down data and digital silos and create platforms that allow many to participate the right mix consider carefully who to partner with externally as part of your ecosystem bringing different players together will enhance consumer experience there is commercial strength in the private sector and large enterprises working together it s not about who gets the biggest piece of the pie the pie is growing exponentially turning to talent anticipate change by investing in education and research now retrain your employees so that they can develop the skills needed to succeed in a digital world encourage employees at all levels to work together and give them the time and space to innovate this issue of how to get effective movement of research ideas into commercial practice is an important one for any industry it s particularly challenging across the university business divide academics like to work with ideas and business people like to work with products and services that make money it isn t easy to cross that divide successfully and often if canada can figure out a way to make it happen with ai it could be good for that country and the world at large follow me on twitter check out my website

150,decades of research have shown that one of the best long term investments a government can make is in improving vulnerable children s start to life research shows that support for pregnant women and for infants until they start school could help countries make a 10 to 13 return on investment each year this would be in the form of enhanced productivity and better life outcomes while the state would spend less on remedial education healthcare and the criminal justice system that s because young children s brains are like sponges they absorb every experience and interaction around them and use that to learn about who they are and how they fit into the world by the time a child turns five 90 of their brain will have developed which means that the quality of the care and education they receive during that time can influence how the rest of their life unfolds where they go to school for example or whether or not they end up in jail have developmental delays and more experts say that s the reason it s so important that the people who educate and care for kids during the early years be trained paid and valued commensurate with their responsibility to shape the next generation of healthy and productive adults and yet the reality on the ground in most countries is that the early childhood education and care ecec workforce is undervalued underpaid and overworked in a bid to learn more about this workforce the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd surveyed staff and leaders in early care and pre primary settings in nine oecd countries denmark israel south korea chile germany iceland japan norway and turkey the talis starting strong survey p 256 was conducted in phases between 2016 and 2018 by a consortium made up of the oecd the international association for the evaluation of educational achievement iea rand europe and statistics canada it involved distributing a questionnaire to nearly 12 000 ecec staffers in 2 085 pre primary centers in the selected countries as well as roughly 4 000 carers in 745 centers for children under the age of three the questionnaire was available both online and in paper form as well as in english and the language of the nine oecd countries surveyed the biggest limitation of the survey is also what makes it most interesting it relies exclusively on self reporting by ecec staffers meaning that it reflects their biases and beliefs data was also limited for certain countries denmark for example had a relatively low participation rate and the report rates the data collected there as insufficient while the countries are all different in terms of size population and gdp the survey provides insights into the common barriers these workers say they face these include staff shortages classroom size and lack of funding and professional development opportunities but perhaps one of the biggest barriers is pay the survey shows that in all the countries surveyed fewer than two in five staff members report being satisfied with their salary and across the board pre primary teachers earn less than their peers who teach older children 78 of the former s average salaries to be exact the report clarifies that part of this difference could be chalked up to the fact that some ecec staffers have lower qualifications and don t work full time but other research shows that all things being equal teachers who work with younger kids typically earn less than those who work with older ones better pay helps attract and retain higher quality workers in any field but it s especially important for early caregivers because as the report states s taff perceptions of being valued by society are likely shaped at least in part by the salaries they receive the survey showed that staffers across all nine countries p 121 were more likely to report feeling valued by their students and their students parents than by society in israel about 75 of pre primary staffers either agreed or strongly agreed that they were valued by society in japan it was about 31 one of the key factors to which the oecd report points is salary progression and its effect on attrition rates this means that turnover could be reduced even if ecec workers earn very little when they start out by offering them the possibility of earning a lot more if they stay on the talis survey included data on pay scale progression which was collected by the oecd for an earlier report called education at a glance in seven of the nine surveyed countries the data showed that four countries provided very little opportunity for wage growth over time while three provided more opportunities for it for example in south korea a public pre primary staffer s average salary at the start of their career could be as low as 32 485 us dollar equivalent converted using purchasing power parity ,4814,1,0.0002077274615704196

154,this is the text of a speech delivered by ian bremmer on november 18 at the 2019 gzero summit in tokyo china has made its decision beijing is building a separate system of chinese technology its own standards infrastructure and supply chains to compete with the west make no mistake this is the single most consequential geopolitical decision taken in the last three decades it s also the greatest threat to globalization since the end of world war ii it wasn t supposed to be like this globalization has lifted billions of people from poverty around the world we now live longer healthier and more productive lives than ever before we are better educated and better informed than at any time in history there has never been a better place and a better time to be alive than right here right now so why are so many people so angry and why is globalization under unprecedented threat related stories ideas even if netanyahu is done his damage to israel will linger for years ideas trump s actions in ukraine weren t just wrong they were dangerous why are citizens in country after country bitterly casting aside both governing and opposition parties in favor of political disruptors at this moment in history why is there so much alarm because this is a moment of transformation and uncertainty in much of the world the lightning fast cross border flows of ideas information people money goods and services the same forces that have created so much opportunity and prosperity also generate fear fear that the world now becomes more complicated and more dangerous in real time fear that the world we knew is gone for good and fear that no one is willing and able to do anything about it i want to talk with you today about why all this is happening and why it s so vitally important that we re having this conversation at this moment and in the heart of this great country japan is both blessed and burdened by its unique place in this g zero world japan has the political stability the foresight and the technological talent to help lead the world into a brighter future than the one we currently face we all have reason to hope that japan s leaders its companies its political will and its people will help lead the transition toward a new order one in which human ingenuity moral imagination and courage can help all of us meet the challenges to come the geopolitical recession when i started eurasia group in 1998 our clients were interested almost exclusively in the so called emerging markets countries those that presented both big growth opportunities and unfamiliar political challenges i defined an emerging market as any country where politics matters at least as much as economic fundamentals for market outcomes countries like japan the united states canada and

economies and markets in even the world s richest countries we also face a growing number of transnational threats the u s led global order is finished so many of the dark clouds now hanging over us from climate change to cyber conflict from terrorism to the post industrial revolution move unchecked across borders leaving national governments much less able to meet the needs of their citizens today it is not economics but geopolitics that has become the main driver of global economic uncertainty the world has entered a geopolitical recession a bust cycle for the international system and relations among governments it s a time when alliances institutions and the values that bind them together are all coming apart from an historical perspective geopolitical recessions are both rarer than economic recessions and longer lasting we ll be living in this geopolitical recession for at least a decade to come how did we get here economists tell us that the process of creative destruction fuels the engine of growth that builds the future and history says that s true but lives and livelihoods are destroyed in the process and growing numbers of people say their government is either powerless to help them manage or doesn t care what happens to them resentment of elites is on the rise in every region of the world the system is rigged against them they believe it s increasingly hard to argue they re wrong this creates opportunities for a new breed of populist who offers scapegoats and promises of protection these politicians did not invent this problem they re just profiting from it related ideas what happens next in the chile protests and the greatest worry is this all this anger is building in good economic times what happens when economies start to slow history shows that governments that are unpopular at home are more likely to make trouble abroad especially with their neighbors to rally public support and divert attention from domestic troubles that breeds less trust among governments the risk of misunderstanding rises accidents are more likely and more likely to escalate toward conflict there are three implications to consider the first centers on tail risks the low likelihood but high impact events that have become commonplace in a world reshaped by china s rise middle east turmoil populist europe revanchist russia divided america a world record 71 million displaced people and the destabilizing effects of technological and climate changes imagine a military accident in the south china sea at a time when the u s and chinese presidents are locked in a war of wills over trade and technology and determined to project strength at home that spirals out of control turn to the middle east the u s has confronted iran since president trump withdrew the u s from the iran nuclear deal and then re imposed sanctions iran has taken bold military action including a strike on the heart of saudi arabia s oil infrastructure washington responded by sending troops to saudi arabia a move which you might recall sharply increased the risk of terrorism in the u s a generation ago what if president trump is defeated for re election next year and north korea s kim jong un discovers the next u s president won t accept his phone calls what provocative action might he take what accidents might he risk what if a debt crisis hits italy created when a future italian government defies eu budget rules and inadvertently creates a financial crisis too large for lenders to manage or a miscalculation in ukraine pulls russia into a shooting war or a us russia cyber confrontation hits critical infrastructure creating a humanitarian crisis inside an american city related history i was just a man who sang a song about freedom 30 years later david hasselhoff looks back on his surprising role in the fall of the berlin wall the lack of coordinated leadership in today s world our g zero world makes all of these crises both more likely to happen and more difficult to manage when they do individually they are long shots collectively they pose unprecedented danger the second implication of the geopolitical recession is the breakdown of international institutions the tens of millions of displaced people around the world today create one of the most urgent and expensive problems that the united nations has to cope with yet even as national governments are less willing to welcome big numbers of refugees even fewer are willing to invest more to support the un refugee agency we also see fragmentation of european institutions as voters send growing numbers of anti eu politicians to serve in the european parliament there is no longer consensus among europeans on the free movement of eu citizens across borders on how to manage immigrants from outside the eu or on important questions like how best to manage relations with russia the trump administration has threatened the coherence of nato the most successful military alliance in history french president macron certainly seems to agree and has withdrawn the us from the trans pacific partnership trade deal the intermediate range nuclear forces treaty with russia the un human rights council and the paris climate accord to name only a few the inevitable consequence of all this is a world that has become more unpredictable and much less safe there is little chance in this environment to establish new agreements and new institutions to help manage tomorrow s crises instead individual governments will adopt their own rules in an attempt to contain challenges that don t respect borders they will threaten economic penalties and military retaliation in a world with fewer institutions able to enforce generally accepted rules and practices related history what happened the day the berlin wall fell the last implication of the geopolitical recession the weakness of today s international system not only leaves the world more vulnerable to crisis but less resilient when crisis comes in recent years we ve avoided a major international crisis we ve seen brexit the election of donald trump the growth of populism across europe russia s bid to undermine ukraine s independence xi jinping s consolidation of power in china a meltdown in venezuela and plenty of individual fires in the middle east and in democracies across the world but we have not yet experienced anything during this period that poses a challenge to the entire international system and the global economy has remained relatively strong our luck can t last there is one superpower in today s world one country that can project political economic and military power into every region that superpower is still the united states that s why it matters so much that americans themselves no longer agree on what role their country should play in the world everywhere i travel including here in japan i hear questions and concerns about president donald trump as if he is the source of all this confusion as if his departure from the political stage either next year or in five would set america and the world on a path back toward some idea of normal that s not going to happen because donald trump is a symptom not a source of this anxiety and confusion yes it is trump who questions the value of nato and whether us troops should be stationed abroad trump is the one who suggests japan and south korea should develop nuclear weapons of their own to relieve burdens on the united states the one who has declared a trade war on china while threatening europe japan mexico and even canada honestly who threatens canada but step back a dozen years and think about why barack obama was elected president after eight years of george w bush s war on terror it was obama who promised to end the wars in iraq and afghanistan and not to start new ones other democrats including hillary clinton were tainted in the minds of many americans by their support for the war on saddam hussein step back further in 1992 bill clinton promised that the end of the cold war meant the end of cold war burdens he promised a peace dividend money no longer needed to defeat the soviets that could instead be invested in strengthening america at home americans don t want to run the world they haven t for a long time and with each passing year there are fewer americans old enough to remember the cold war to say nothing of world war ii in fact there are now american soldiers on the ground in afghanistan who were not yet born on september 11 2001 the reluctance of the united states as a superpower creates a global vacuum of leadership but no one is stepping up to take that role in the way that more than a century ago america emerged just as the sun began to set on the british empire europe remains profoundly preoccupied particularly over economic issues dividing north and south and political issues dividing east and west and while president xi jinping has declared a new era for china in the world china s leadership remains fundamentally cautious when it comes to accepting heavy international burdens that s why when it comes to international leadership beijing will not soon become any more reliable a provider of public goods than washington and why a future crisis will be so hard to manage fallout for globalization then there is the impact of geopolitical recession on globalization itself globalization has changed our understanding of how things are made and how we might live around the world we celebrate our national holidays with fireworks made in china the customer service calls we make to fix our computers are answered in india our cars are made from parts that come from dozens of countries we are all globally integrated it is no longer meaningful to say where our products are produced and until recently politics hasn t played a big part in these processes that s no longer true there is no longer a global free market china soon to be the world s largest economy practices state capitalism a system that allows government officials to ensure that economic growth ultimately serves political and national interests china s state capitalist system distorts the traditional workings of a market driven economy by relying heavily on state owned enterprises and state backed national champions to ensure economic and therefore political stability it depends on state subsidies that allow political officials to direct enormous amounts of capital and other resources as they choose the government picks winners and losers the success of this system for china and the chinese communist party is undeniable the good news for the rest of us is that chinese growth has supported global growth crucially the hybrid global economy it has created does not end globalization both free market and state capitalist systems still enable goods and capital to move around the world but the future of globalization is not so simple different parts of the global economy are adapting to the end of the us led global order in different ways the marketplace for commodities especially food metals and energy indeed is only becoming more globalized us and chinese tariffs dominate the news for as long as they last but the bigger story is the expansion of global commodity markets new technologies are making energy production more efficient and lowering costs at a faster pace than politics can drive them higher that s why even after a dramatic missile strike earlier this year at the heart of saudi oil infrastructure knocked half of saudi oil production offline the resulting jump in oil prices left them at levels just half of what they were in 2008 with more than a billion people entering a global middle class over the past two generations and the pace of that growth increasing the globalization of the commodities market will continue the market for goods and services on the other hand will become less global that s in part because the role of labor in production is shrinking dramatically as new technologies bring automation and machine learning into the workplace manufacturers want to produce where production is least expensive that won t change what has changed is the search for cheap labor because the rise of middle classes in china india southeast asia latin america and sub saharan africa has increased wages everywhere giving producers good reason to automate production further the growth in populism we ve seen in so many countries is driven in part by anger over job losses that means that political officials are more likely to build barriers designed to protect local jobs than to restrict the flow of trade these trends will shorten global supply chains for goods and services as each country or company works to reduce its vulnerability to disruption in countries involved in trade disputes it won t happen immediately because ceos don t want to make difficult decisions until they believe they have to but as the global economy tightens those executives will increasingly produce goods and services where the customers are finally there is the global market for data and information this market is breaking in two it is no longer global in the beginning the internet the worldwide web was driven by a single set of standards and rules with very few exceptions one consumer had virtually the same access as another no longer today china and the united states are building two distinct online ecosystems that s true for the transformation of today s internet but also for the construction of the new internet of things the american tech ecosystem with all its strengths and shortcomings is built by the private sector and loosely regulated by the government the chinese system is dominated by the state that s also true for big data collection for development of artificial intelligence for the rollout of 5g cellular network technology and for defense and retaliation against cyberattacks this leaves us with a big question where exactly will the new berlin wall stand where will we find the boundary between one technological system and the other will europe align with the united states or will the eu fragment into individual decisions within individual european countries how will india position itself and south korea and brazil what pressures will even japan face there is another fundamental question will the us led data and information model continue to be driven by the private sector or will future fears for national security allow for the creation of a tech based military industrial complex in the us the answers to these questions carry profound implications in the markets for commodities goods and services global players are both competitors and potential partners each player wants more market share but everyone benefits from an open trading system that creates opportunities for all trade wars may be launched to achieve specific goals but this isn t a zero sum competition business as usual promises something for everyone that s a critical support for global peace and prosperity this is no longer true in the data and information economy here much as in the us soviet cold war the existence of two competing systems limits commercial opportunities and threatens national security each side s hoped for outcome is elimination of the other system america and china which means that we now need to talk about china and the united states what should the rest of the world want from china we should want it to succeed the world needs china to remain stable productive and increasingly prosperous to fuel global growth we need china to play a constructive international role even if only a limited one to work with other governments to meet the challenges posed by poverty conflict public health risks lack of education lack of infrastructure climate change and the advance of disruptive new technologies and of course we need these things from the united states too the threat china poses to the us is smaller than many in washington believe china has even less interest in going to war with the us than the us has in going to war with china china is a regional but not a global military power economic interdependence will continue despite concerted efforts on both sides to reduce economic vulnerabilities the greatest source of us china conflict comes from technology here china is today a true superpower here there is a cold war structure to the relationship that will affect every region of the world here the us does have an interest in seeing china fail because china s technological development poses a foundational challenge to the values on which global stability and prosperity depend this is a subject on which america s democrats and republicans agree imagine that the stakes are real the idea of a splinternet the creation of parallel technology ecosystems isn t just a threat to globalization it s a competition that those who believe in political freedoms might lose what should we do allow me to offer two proposals the first is the creation of an organization equivalent to the un s intergovernmental panel on climate change the body that s responsible for objectively assessing the world s vulnerability and responses to climate change we need a similar group to establish ground rules for our digital world the data and artificial intelligence that fuel it and its future development my second proposal is this the world needs a digital wto a world data organization as with the wto uniting governments that believe in online openness and transparency in an organization that china will ultimately have an economic and security incentive to want to join especially if it s the only way beijing can secure access to developed markets carrots will work better than sticks america europe japan and like minded willing and able partners must work together to set future standards for artificial intelligence data privacy citizens

156,this past summer oxford university was again ranked as the topmost university in the world according to an article in the wall street journal 1 while the article dutifully numbered the top universities across the globe one seemingly small statistic stood out at least to me for the first time china is now spending more money on higher education than any other nation the united states has faced other challenges from other nations before it went to war against the axis powers in the middle of the 20th century it managed its way through a cold war against the soviet union it responded to the rise of japan in the latter half of the 20th century now it confronts a rapidly rising china but there is an important difference in this latest confrontation for the first time in a century the us faces a rival that is investing more in higher education than the us is itself and this investment differential is likely to grow wider over time due to its larger geographic size and larger population relative to earlier challengers the us had a big advantage in its knowledge base to fuel its innovation against the soviets the us had a larger economy invested more in higher education and even managed to attract many of the leading german scientists after world war ii against the japanese the us had a much much larger economy and a much larger population as well as more investment in higher education this advantage gave the us a big edge in innovation whether it was in developing superior weapons systems and consumer goods relative to the soviets or inventing new industries in response to the japanese challenge today china s economy is approaching the size of that of the us while its population is more than four times the size of the us and the country has steadily and strongly expanded its spending on higher education to prepare for an even brighter future since china knew that it would take many years to strengthen its own universities it has also provided generous funding for young masters and doctoral students to study at excellent international universities not only in the us but throughout the developed economies in western europe canada and australia china calculated that allowing its citizens to study abroad would strengthen their knowledge and that most of them would likely return to china and put that enhanced knowledge to work in the chinese economy this meant that china did not need to wait for its own universities to catch up in order to increase its innovation capability as a result we in the us now face a near peer in innovation infrastructure the innovation infrastructure consists of the hard and soft assets in the society to generate disseminate and absorb new innovative knowledge this requires investments in hard assets like 5g connectivity or up to date airports roads and train stations as well as investments in soft assets like training skills universities and other forms of human capital development the infrastructure starts with public investment which in turn attracts a larger amount of private investment which culminates in greater innovation capability for the whole society while the chattering classes are concerned about trade policies and tariff barriers between the us and china the competition in innovation capability is the one to watch for the longer term while the us still enjoys a significant lead it is clear that the chinese are catching up in a number of industries it is also clear that china has the political will and the economic ability to invest in strengthening its innovation infrastructure for the longer term in the meantime we in the us are coasting on the innovation infrastructure investments made decades ago in the 1940s the congress passed the gi bill that sent millions of returning soldiers to college in the 1950s the us built its interstate highway system in the 1960s the us reached the moon with the apollo program and its military built leading satellite and missile systems that gave rise to silicon valley in recent decades though the us has slowed down its investment in its future federal government spending on r d has been flat and is trending down as a percentage of the gdp of the economy the us has neglected major parts of its physical infrastructure whether that be roads with potholes collapsing bridges or overcrowded airports its primary and secondary education systems are falling behind those of many other countries even the excellent us higher education system is providing far too few scientists engineers and technicians to the us for its 21st century economy and much of the funding for higher education has shifted from government support to private funding saddling millions of students with terrific amounts of debt at the very start of their professional careers perhaps we need to take a lesson from china which is investing steadily in a stronger knowledge base without forcing its students to incur large amounts of debt the most promising path for the us is to renew its investment in its innovation infrastructure to empower us businesses and us citizens to compete more effectively in the global economy and with interest rates approaching historically low levels the cost of financing this investment is surprisingly affordable 1 oxford tops global university rankings as china continues to make gains wsj
